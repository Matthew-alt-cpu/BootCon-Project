Automated Packet Capturing with T-Shark into        SPLUNK

# Slide 2:

What is T-Shark?
T-Shark is a Network Packet Analyzer that unlike the popular tool “Wireshark”, does not have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and instead works solely from the command line of a terminal.

# Slide 3:

T-Shark in Security

T-Shark is a handy tool for Cyber Security professionals providing useful:

Network Security
Attack monitoring
Network Packet Analysis
Incident Response
Powerful Network Filtering

# Slide 4:
Okay and what are the advantages?

No Payment required.

Easy to install and access.

Fast use and packet capturing.

Can work in conjunction with other tools.

Man/Help page assistance.

# Slide 5:

Any Disadvantages?

Learning curve.

Lack of a graphical user interface can result  in large packets of data being difficult to navigate through.
Threat Analysis

# Slide 6:

Sounds efficient, but why not Wireshark?

Wireshark is  a great tool for capturing and analysing network packet data however where it truly shines is through navigating large amounts of traffic.

I and possibly many others, prefer to work on the command line and enjoy learning the syntax and commands.

# Slide 7:

What is the Goal for using T-Shark?

The main goal of using T-Shark is to perform packet capturing and analysis in an efficient and timely manner whilst displaying the power of automation. This goal will be  achieved through -

Applying specific T-Shark Filters.

Combining T-Shark with Bash Scripting.

Importing the data into SPLUNK

# Slide 8:

Did you do any Research?

The Research conducted involved the understanding of:

Bash Scripting and execution.

T-Shark Installation, functions and usage.

T-Shark commands, filtering and exfiltration.

SPLUNK Data types.

# Slide 9:

What are the Steps to Achieve the Goal?

Step 1) Work solely within the command Terminal

Step 2) Create a bash script that automates packet capturing with T-Shark.

Step 3) Create an attack machine to perform a XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack on DVWA Domain.

Step 4) Through T-Shark create .csv files with filtered information.

Step 5) Add the data to SPLUNK 

# Slide 10:

Show me a Demonstration

(This Slide Presentation briefly stopped as I conducted a live demonstration of the project)

# Slide 11:

Wow that really was quick, how about a Summary?

In a few short minutes we were able to:

Create an automated bash script that can be reused.

Capture specific network packet data based on our desired fields.

Imported the data into Splunk for further analysis.

Extra Notes:
We can also create a Cron-Job  from the automated task so the script can start and finish when we choose.

Any Questions? I don’t bite.
