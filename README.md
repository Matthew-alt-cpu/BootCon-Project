# BootCon-Project
# My Final Project for my Cyber Security course focusing on the Automation and Reusability of tasks.
# To acheive this I have selected to use the Network Packet Analyser Wireshark's command line console Tshark in conjunction with Bash Scripting.
# The Process to acheive my outlined objective, involved opening an attack machine terminal that would perform a cross-site scripting attack on the DVWA Domain. At the same time the defending machine will run the Bash Script allowing for Tshark to capture the data and write specific information to specified files.
# From here the goal is to create 3 seperate files all containign different data pertaining to the files specificities.
# 1 File for general Network Logs, 1 for isolating data teh would pertain to an attempted cyber attack and 1 for importing directly into Splunk for further analysis.
